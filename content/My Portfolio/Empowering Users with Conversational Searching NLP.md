### *Disclaimer*

I want to clarify that this is part of my personal project, and I am not affiliated or associated with Hotpads. The project is solely undertaken for personal purposes, such as learning, experimentation, or showcasing my skills. Any references or examples related to Hotpads are used purely for illustrative purposes and should not be misconstrued as an endorsement or official representation by Hotpads.

### Introduction

In this case study, I have outlined my process of designing a Chatbot for a house searching application, taking inspiration from the popular platform Hotpads. It is important to note that this is a personal project and not an official collaboration with or endorsement from Hotpads. The purpose of this case study is to showcase my skills and demonstrate how I approached the design of a Chatbot specifically tailored for house searching, drawing insights from the user experience provided by Hotpads.

## **Problem Statement**

> *The real estate application Hotpads lacks an efficient and user-friendly chatbot system to assist users in their house searching process. Users currently face challenges in finding relevant information, navigating through listings, and receiving personalized recommendations. There is a need to design and implement a well-designed chatbot solution that can enhance the user experience, provide accurate and timely information, and streamline the house searching process on the Hotpads platform.*

## 🔥  Planning and Discovery
---
I started out researching more about chatbot integration how they actually work. Initially, I listed down the software that would make my workflow look cleaner and understandable. As working as a solo ux designer I use a software management tool which is also a task-management tool Jira helps me setup my workflow and track my progress throughout the project. I will be running a short workshops on miro for brainstorming and ideation. For the visual designing and prototype I will be using figma for a smooth design operation. 

### Design Process

For this project, I’ve used double diamond technique

### Brainstorming and Problem Framing

To have something as a starting point, I basically started searching for ideas and assumptions that I had in my mind for a chatbot design. I jot down a list of ideas and assumptions to clarify what I was going to design and for whom.

- Based on the research in 2022, the total cost saving from deploying chatbot reached around $11B. And this number will only continue to grow as more and more businesses adopts the technology. It’s not really surprising as chatbot can save businesses upto 30% of cost on customer support alone.
- Most of the information regarding how chatbots increase conversions is usually taken out of context. It is true that chatbots can increase sales conversions in some industries by 70%, but it is difficult to establish universal chatbot benchmarks

### Cons of Using Chatbots {[Source ->](https://www.chatdesk.com/blog/pros-and-cons-of-chatbots#:~:text=Chatbots%20have%20limited%20responses%2C%20so,to%20contact%20your%20support%20team)}

- **Don’t understand Natural Language** : Most chatbots are unable to adapt their language to match that of humans, which means slang, misspelling, sarcasm are often not understood by a bot. This means that chatbot typically can’t be used by a channel that are public and highly personal. This creates a a hiccup for the bots and impedes the quicks service your customer was looking for.
- **No Personalized or Emotive** - Bots aren’t going respond to your customer with personalization or emotion which is a big detractor for a lot of customers. Especially when experiencing an issue with a product or company, customer wants their frustration to be met with empathy.
- **Higher Capacity for Misunderstanding** : When a customer’s question isn’t clear or is too specific. A bot may have a hard time helping. Which is one of the biggest disadvantages of chatbot. Chatbots are programmed to answer general question with answers that can be found in it’s database. So if customer ask something outside of this narrow list of answerable questions, they likely to confuse the bot and will be either taken around in circles as the bot tries to understand without an answer.
- **Need to be maintained** : Chatbots need frequent optimization to make sure they are giving the right information to your customers and representing your brand appropriately. As your user demand and business priorities shift, you’ll need to update your bot accordingly, which requires analysis of previous bot conversations to identify common questions your bot receives.
