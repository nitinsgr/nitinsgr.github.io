## 1. Overview

---

### **Introduction**

This case study is written totally for my personal understanding and I was not part of any project that involved enhancing the dining experience. However, as a UX designer, I believe that any experience can be improved with the right approach and design. 

*By identifying pain points and areas for improvement, I hope to demonstrate the value of user-centered design in creating a more enjoyable and memorable dining experience. Please note that this case study is solely intended for educational purposes and not related to any specific project or client.*

### Problem Statement

*The current restaurant reservation app for diners lacks usability and efficiency, resulting in a frustrating and inconvenient booking experience. Users encounter challenges in finding available reservations, navigating through a complex booking process, and receiving personalized recommendations. Communication with restaurants is inefficient, and the review system is inadequate for making informed dining choices.*

### Solution

I completed this project within a span of 4 weeks, following the design process from empathizing to usability testing to reach a valid conclusion for the project.

### **My Role**

I was a solo UX/UI Designer on this project, where I had the opportunity to take charge of all the tasks and workshops involved. As the sole designer, I was responsible for every aspect of the user experience and interface design, from conceptualization to final implementation.

## 2. Design Process

---

By combining user-centered design principles, design thinking methodologies, and iterative testing. I was able to solve the design problem and deliver my solution for this project.

We used design-thinking methodology of 5 phases to solve this problem

## 3. Understanding the Problem Statement

---

The covid-10 pandemic has significantly impacted the restaurant industry, Leading to a new set of challenges that establishements must navigate in the post-covid-19 era. As restuarants adapt to evloving landscape, they face unique problems both during and after pandemic.

### During the Covid-19 Pandemic

- Health and safety measures : Restaurants enforced health protocols, including sanitization, social distancing, and limited seating, impacting revenue and operations.
- Financial Strain : Restaurants faced financial challenges due to reduced customers and restrictions on dine-in services. Adaptation and financial support were crucial for survival.

### In the New Normal

- Changing the customer behavior : Consumer preferences shifted to health, hygiene, and contactless experiences. Restaurants must adapt with touchless services, safety transparency, and flexible dining.
- Post-lockdown, the desire to socialize and dine out has surged, leading to increased demand for restaurant services. Relaxation of restrictions has resulted in crowded establishments.
- Temporary closure, reduced operating hours or the closure of the restaurant during the uncertain period of time resulted in limited dining alternatives for the customer.
- Popular or unique restaurants may attract larger crowds regardless of the pandemic. Managing the influx of customers, particularly during peak hours, poses challenges for such establishments.

## 4. Formulating Assumptions and testable hypothesis statements

---

Assumptions are made based on understanding the problem, existing data, and research. They are prioritized and tested to validate their impact and uncertainties. Thorough research enables informed decision-making by either proving or disproving assumptions, leading to evidence-based solutions.

![Slide 16_9 - 1.svg](Dinezo%20-%20Improving%20dining%20experience%20c2565ab8c31e4b54bd987d064a6b307e/Slide_16_9_-_1.svg)

To validate my assumptions, I categorized and identified the most challenging and risky ones. I transformed these assumptions into testable hypothesis statements to ensure they are validated through experiments and tools. The goal is to prove their validity and carry them forward in the next stages of the process.

![Slide 16_9 - 2.svg](Dinezo%20-%20Improving%20dining%20experience%20c2565ab8c31e4b54bd987d064a6b307e/Slide_16_9_-_2.svg)

## 5. Empathize

---

At this stage, a collection of insights about the users were made. Understanding the behaviour and mindset of the user helped me solve the problem for them. It enabled the delivery of a seamless exeprience by having an extensive understanding of how user interact with the relevant products.

### Target user group

## 4. Define And Analyzing Data

---

### **Affinity Diagram**

To organize research findings, I used an affinity mapping technique. I put down each insight on one sticky note, found patterns, and grouped them together. As a result, I got 3 main user groups

![Slide 16_9 - 3.svg](Dinezo%20-%20Improving%20dining%20experience%20c2565ab8c31e4b54bd987d064a6b307e/Slide_16_9_-_3.svg)

### Empathy Mapping

An empathy map is valuable tool in understanding and empathizing with users or customers. It helps us gain insight into their thoughts, feelings motiviations, and pain-points. Allowing us to design a product that better meets their needs. I drafted an empathy map based on one of my user from the interview session.

![Journey Map (33).png](Dinezo%20-%20Improving%20dining%20experience%20c2565ab8c31e4b54bd987d064a6b307e/Journey_Map_(33).png)

### Refining overall insights

Based on the valuable information collected from the interview sessions, problem mapping(Affinity Map), and empathy map, we have gained deeper insights into the needs and pain points of our users. This data has allowed us to refine our understanding of their experiences and identify areas where improvements can be made.

By this point, I had my problem statement refined

The current reservation system in the restaurant lacks essential features and functionality, leading to a subpar user experience for diners. These issues encompass limited search capabilities, challenges with overcrowding and availability, a complex and lengthy reservation process, and a lack of real-time updates. The absence of a standardized user experience across different channels further compounds the problem, causing confusion and frustration among users.

### ***How might we enhance the dining experience of customers by providing an efficient and convenient reservation system, accommodating various seating preferences, offering flexible booking options, and providing real-time updates to ensure a seamless and satisfying dining experience?***

### How might we? (HMW)

Now to create questions out of these problems, the how might we statement method is used. The outcome of HMW method is to give a point to ideate solutions.

- How might we simplify the online reservation process to make it more user-friendly and intuitive for customers?
- How might we improve the search and filtering options to help customers and find restaurant that aligns their dietary and other specific preferences.
- How might we ensure accurate and real-time availability information to prevent customers from encountering booking conflicts and unavaibility time slots.
- How might we enhance the mobile user experience for the online reservation, ensuring responsiveness and optimized performance across different devices.
- How might we incorporate personalized recommendations and tailored suggestions based on customers' past dining preferences and feedback?
- How might we provide proactive communication and notifications, keeping customers updated about their reservation status, any changes, or special offers?
- How might we streamline the process of adding special requests or dietary restrictions during the online reservation, ensuring that restaurants are adequately prepared to meet customer needs?

## 5. Ideate

## 7. Usability Testing (Link to Usability test Report)

---

To see how people interact with wireframes and whether the product idea meets their expectations, I conducted several iterations of usability testing.

A total number of 8 participants were tested with the product. participants in the test were daily customers and users who uses similar application to book online reservation to plan their dine-out. Participants were recruited by me and were compensated with Amazon Gift Cards for their time.

### Participant’s Background

Recruited participants had a mix of backgrounds and demographic characteristics conforming to the recruitment screener.

### Study Design

Overall, the objective of this test was to uncover areas where the application performed well that is, effectively, efficiently and satisfactory would be the area where application would fail to meet the needs of the users. This test serves as both means to record or benchmark current usability, but also to identify areas where improvement must be made. A detailed description is shared in the usability test report (Link)

![Tasks and Scenarios for the test](Dinezo%20-%20Improving%20dining%20experience%20c2565ab8c31e4b54bd987d064a6b307e/Untitled%201.png)

Tasks and Scenarios for the test

### Test Environment

After careful consideration, I settled on a combination of video conferencing software and screen sharing tools that were user friendly and ensured a seamless testing experience.

Screen Sharing and Video Conferencing: Google Meet

Test Setup and Environment: Quant-UX (Open-source tool to measure your product success)

![Untitled](Dinezo%20-%20Improving%20dining%20experience%20c2565ab8c31e4b54bd987d064a6b307e/Untitled%202.png)

### Defining Usability Metrics

To measure the usability of the product the goal for users is to interact with prototype effectively, efficiently and with acceptable level of satisfaction. To assess the test goal

- **Effectiveness**  should be measured through participant’s success rate and error rate.
- **Efficiency** should be measured the average time taken on each task and time based efficiency method.
- **Satisfaction** should be measured through task rating and SEQ shared with the participant upon completion of each task.

## 8 Results and Measurements

### Quantitative Data Measurement

![Untitled](Dinezo%20-%20Improving%20dining%20experience%20c2565ab8c31e4b54bd987d064a6b307e/Untitled%203.png)

- Task completion rates were analyzed to measure overall product effectiveness. Task 2 had a 62% completion rate, indicating room for improvement. Task 3 achieved 100% completion. Error rates were also considered, with Task 2 having a 70% error rate, while Task 4 performed the best with the lowest errors. Areas requiring improvement include Task 2 and Task 1, ensuring better user experience and increased effectiveness.
- The efficiency rate and time on task completion were measured to assess performance. Task 2 had the highest average time on task, taking 257 goal/sec. In contrast, Task 4 had the quickest completion time. However, when evaluating overall relative efficiency, Task 4 achieved a lower efficiency rate of 76%, while Task 1 had the highest efficiency rate of 100% for completing the task.
- The satisfaction rate was assessed using a combination of qualitative and quantitative data. Participants were asked open-ended questions after completing each task, allowing them to provide subjective feedback. Additionally, participants were asked to complete a SEQ (Semantic Differential Scale) and rate the task on a Likert scale ranging from 1 to 7.

### Qualitative Data Measurement

I recorded their behavior, interactions, and reactions during the testing session. This included noting any gestures, facial expressions, and verbal cues that provided insights into their thoughts and experiences. I paid close attention to their navigation patterns, the features they interacted with, and any difficulties or confusion they encountered.

![Untitled](Dinezo%20-%20Improving%20dining%20experience%20c2565ab8c31e4b54bd987d064a6b307e/Untitled%204.png)

Throughout the observation, I also took detailed notes to capture any noteworthy observations or specific moments that stood out. This data would later be analyzed and used to identify usability issues, areas of improvement, and potential design enhancements for the tested product or interface.

### Post-Test Usability Results

To conclude the overall test results and data collected, I administered a post-usability test questionnaire called SUS (System Usability Scale). This standardized scale provides valuable insights into the usability of the system and allows for a quantitative assessment of user satisfaction and perceived ease of use.

![Untitled](Dinezo%20-%20Improving%20dining%20experience%20c2565ab8c31e4b54bd987d064a6b307e/Untitled%205.png)

Based on research, a SUS score above a 68 would be considered above average and anything below 68 is below average, By analyzing the SUS scores and participant feedback, I gained a comprehensive understanding of the system's usability and identified areas for improvement. This information will be instrumental in shaping future design iterations and enhancing the overall user experience.

### Recommendations and Iterations

I’ve collected most of the data on recommendation, changes and justification from the participants about the current product interface and information accuracy rate. Most of the participants faced problems with : 

- I recognized the challenges users faced with the user interface's lack of responsiveness and layout issues.
- Another issue users encountered was the lengthy process to navigate and join the waiting list.
- The confusion surrounding the "Join Waiting List" call-to-action (CTA) on the restaurant's page after users joined the waiting list is another important issue.
- users faced difficulties editing wrongly filled dietary preferences. To enhance the user experience in this aspect, I implemented an easy-to-use editing feature.

Through iterations and testing, I refined the design, streamlined navigation, and implemented intuitive features to address the usability concerns. I focused on improving clarity, simplicity, and user-friendliness throughout the entire user journey.

## 9. Final Results

Filters and Map View Integration

### Problem 2: Extensive study findings have revealed a reoccurring issue that customers confront when seeking to get confirmed seats at restaurants, which frequently results in anomalous waiting periods or even automated booking cancellations, causing major dissatisfaction among users. To overcome this issue and prevent cart abandonment, effective user management tactics must be used.

### Solution

With Waitlist restaurant’s can still manage their diners even tho they’re full occupied and overcrowded. 

![Animation.gif](Dinezo%20-%20Improving%20dining%20experience%20c2565ab8c31e4b54bd987d064a6b307e/Animation%202.gif)

Some restaurants struggle to effectively manage customers who prefer walk-in dining experiences. It is crucial for these establishments to provide suitable options for walk-in patrons and ensure their needs are met.

### Problem 3: Currently, some of our customers encounter an unusually high number of people during their visit, which may not be conducive to their desired dining experience. How might we overcome from the issue of unusual overcrowding? How do we mitigate the problem.

Through our inclusive research, we discovered that the issue extends beyond overcrowding. Sometimes, restaurants experience low income as a result, making it challenging for them to effectively manage their diners. To address this problem, I have incorporated a few features that not only resolve overcrowding but also facilitate easier customer management for the restaurant.

### Converging users to choose different time slot when restaurant has lesser crowd.
